    "The transition probability $T$ is symmetric, since the probability for flipping any spin is constant. Since the index of the spin to flip is chosen randomly, and thus not dependent on energy or position, the probability of picking any index $i$ is as equal as picking index $j$. Furthermore, the probability is constant over the moves in the system. That means that the probability of picking index $i$ will remain unchanged. Combining this, we can say that $T$ is symmetric.\n",

    "We needn't store all the spin configurations over the whole sequence. We only need to start with an initial state and calculate the relevant quantities in that state. Then, we can say that the initial state is the current state. For every iteration we can flip a spin in the current state, and update the relevant quantities using the deltas explored above. As long as we keep the current state \"up-to-date\", we shouldn't need every step in the sequence."
